Signing up for OnePass is quick and easy. You can choose to sign up using your email address and a password, using an external identity provider (IdP) such as Google, LinkedIn or FundingBox or using a PassKey. This article will guide you through the process.


### Sign-up with your email

To sign up for OnePass using your company email address, go to the [OnePass sign-up](https://app.getonepass.eu/signup) and, in the text boxes, type your email account. You will receive in your email a one-time use code which you can use to access and create your user account (your account as an individual) for the first time. Once the account is created, you can define your preferred authetication method by following these steps:
- Click on your avatar in the right upper corner of the page,
- Tap the "Account settings" option,
- From the headings in the left side, choose "Security", and
- Set-up your preferred authentication method (you can choose to have a password, a passkey, a 2-factor authentication or a third-party app)

Remember to read and accept the terms of service and privacy policy, before signing-up!


### Sign-in with a Passkey

Passkeys are a password replacement that validates your identity using touch, facial recognition, a device password, or a PIN. Passkeys can be used for sign-in as a simple and secure alternative to your password and two-factor credentials.

This browser or device is reporting partial passkey support, but you may be able to use a passkey from a nearby device.


### Sign-in with an External Identity Provider (IdP)

To set up the sign-in for OnePass using an external IdP such as Google, LinkedIn, or FundingBox, follow these steps:

- Visit the [OnePass sign-in](https://app.getonepass.eu/signin), and
- Select the tab for your preferred IdP (Google, LinkedIn, or FundingBox),
- Follow the on-screen instructions to grant OnePass access to your IdP account.
- Once the process is complete, you will be redirected to your OnePass homepage.


### Important Information Regarding Sign-in Methods

Please note that if you sign in using an external IdP, you will only be able to sign in using that same IdP. If you would like to add additional sign-in mechanisms, such as the ability to sign in using a combination of email and password, you will need to link or activate the specific mechanism within your account settings.
