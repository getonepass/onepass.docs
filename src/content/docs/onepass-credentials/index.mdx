# OnePass Credentials: Enabling Trusted Ecosystems with Verifiable Credentials

## Introduction

In today‚Äôs digital landscape, trust is a critical component for seamless collaboration between organizations, institutions, and individuals. Traditional identity and credentialing systems often rely on centralized authorities, creating bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and security vulnerabilities. OnePass Credentials is a next-generation trust-tech solution that enables the creation of decentralized, verifiable, and secure trust ecosystems using verifiable credentials.

## What is OnePass Credentials?

OnePass Credentials is a comprehensive solution designed for network operators, ecosystem builders, and trust service providers to establish their own digital trust services. By leveraging decentralized identity (DID) standards and verifiable credentials (VCs), OnePass Credentials empowers organizations to issue, manage, and verify digital attestations that are tamper-proof and privacy-preserving.

### Two Versions of OnePass Credentials

OnePass Credentials is available in two versions to accommodate different organizational needs:

#### 1. **Cloud-Based Service by OnePass**

- A fully managed, scalable solution operated by OnePass.
- Supports end-to-end trust ecosystem operations, including onboarding participants, managing policies, and facilitating ecosystem-wide interactions.
- Ideal for organizations looking for a plug-and-play trust infrastructure without managing the underlying technology.

#### 2. **Open-Source Self-Hosted Version**

- A deployable version that organizations can host on their own premises.
- Supports credential issuance and verification, as well as onboarding into a trust ecosystem.
- Does not include ecosystem management capabilities, making it a solution focused on decentralized credential management rather than trust network governance.
