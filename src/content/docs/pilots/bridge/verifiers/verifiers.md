# OnePass Bridge Pilot for investors

## Who can be a verifier?"

## Getting verified

### Identity verification 
Claims their KYC Credential: They start the process by going to the OnePass bridge website and requesting a KYC verifiable credential. By doing this, he/she is redirected to the IDnow website where they can complete the self verification process by uploading their ID documents, taking a selfie, completing the verification process and claiming the credential by downloading a mobile wallet and scanning the QR code on the website.

### Legal aspects verification
Claims their KYB Credential: He/she starts the KYB process by going to the OnePass bridge website and requesting a KYB verifiable credential by completing the Online application form. Here they can populate all of the information that verifies the companyâ€™s legal existence status. Once the information has been verified by the OnePass bridge team, he/she will receive an email with a link to claim the credential. Simply by scanning the QR code, he/she can store the credential in the wallet.

After the completion of the KYC and KYB process, the investor will go on to complete their investor profile via OnePass, and then can access their dashboard in order to view and contact verified startups. 

Just like the startups, the investors will receive a badge on their profile confirming that they have been verified. 


## Will investors have access to the pool of verified companies?
View verified startups: Following the verification process, the investor will gain access to view already verified startups and will have the opportunity to contact them directly.

## How I can verify credentials?
Verify startup credentials: In phase 1 of the project, the investor will not verify startups, however, in phase 2, the investor can request a startup with a momentum credential to present it in order to see their investability rating.In phase 1 of the project, the investors will not need to request the credentials of the startup as they will be able to see via a badge on their profile that their credentials already have been verified by the OnePass bridge platform. In phase 2 of the project, the investor will be able to request the investability indicator credential to be presented by the startup (the process will be described in the phase 2 version of this document).
