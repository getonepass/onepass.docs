# Bridge Network: A Cross-Border Trust Network for Investments and Digital Trust

## Abstract

Bridge Network is a dedicated trust ecosystem designed to foster cross-border connections and investments through decentralized trust technologies and verifiable credentials. It provides a framework for startups, investors, and institutions to interact in a secure and transparent environment, enabling streamlined access to funding and compliance verification across jurisdictions.

## Introduction

As global markets become increasingly interconnected, the need for a trusted framework to facilitate cross-border investments and business interactions is more important than ever. Bridge Network serves as a dedicated trust network, bringing together verified startups, investors, and ecosystem enablers to simplify fundraising, compliance, and partnership-building.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Border Investment Facilitation**: A verified ecosystem that connects startups with investors and institutions across multiple jurisdictions.
- **Trust-Based Interactions**: Utilization of verifiable credentials to ensure transparency and reliability in business engagements.
- **Regulatory Compliance Support**: Provides tools for startups and investors to meet cross-border regulatory requirements.
- **Interoperability**: Ensures seamless collaboration with other trust networks and compliance frameworks.
- **Security & Privacy**: Built-in cryptographic protections to safeguard sensitive business data.

## Use Cases

### 1. Startup Fundraising & Investment Validation

Startups can obtain verifiable credentials proving their legal existence and investment readiness, facilitating trusted interactions with investors.

### 2. Cross-Border Business Expansion

Companies looking to expand internationally can leverage Bridge Network to establish credibility and compliance in new markets.

### 3. Investor Due Diligence & Risk Mitigation

Investors can verify the credentials of startups and co-investors within the Bridge Network, reducing fraud and investment risk.

## Relationship with OnePass Platform

While Bridge Network serves as a dedicated trust ecosystem for cross-border connections and investments, it operates using OnePass Credentials, a OnePass Platform product, as its trust-tech solution. OnePass Credentials enables the entire trust network operation, from onboarding participants (TAOs, issuers, verifiers) to managing credentials, policies, and accreditations. It also provides the necessary tools for issuers and verifiers to issue and verify credentials efficiently.

Additionally, OnePass itself acts as a verifier within the network. Credential holders can present their credentials at OnePass Bridge to prove their identities and claims, unlocking additional features and facilitating seamless startup-investor interactions.

## Conclusion

Bridge Network is revolutionizing cross-border investment by establishing a secure, verifiable, and interoperable trust ecosystem. By connecting verified startups, investors, and ecosystem enablers, it simplifies access to funding, ensures compliance, and fosters international business growth.
