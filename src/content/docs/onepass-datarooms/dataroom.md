## Managing your data room

A data room is a safe space to share information and documents with your potential investors or investees. To create your data room, you will have to be subscribed to a plan that includes this functionality.

Click on the option "Data room" of the left side main menu to create it. Note that, when creating a data room, some folders will be predefined and the dataroom should be initiated with a text file (readme.md) that will be used as introductory information when sharing it.

To manage it, click on the "gear" icon ("Settings") to change the name and description of your data room (if you wish so) and rememeber to click the "Save changes" button when you finish.
In the settings section, you can also activate/deactivate these addons:

* File requests
* Transactions
* Updates
* Analytics
[//]: # (Add a description of each feature)

Finally, from the settings, you can also archive or delete a data room here but be **careful**: both these actions will impact on all the links you shared and, in the case of the deletion, the action is not reversible. This is, once that a data room is deleted, it will be gone forever, including all collected data.

Click on the name of the data room, to go back to its content and the tools to manage it that you will find in the following sections.

### Uploading and organising content in your data room

In the "Content" tab, you will find:

* on the left, a search box to find folders or files and a panel including the folders structure (and the files at root level), and
* on the right, a bar with the path of the folder you are navigating and the folder functionalities and, right below, a panel with the list of files included in the folder selected on the left (if selected).

To organise the information in the dataroom, in the three dots to the right of the folders bar, you can:
