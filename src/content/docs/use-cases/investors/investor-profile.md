## Creating a workspace

A "workspace" is a representation of an organization (be it a company, a project or simply a team) to which one person or many people belong and jointly manage.

If you haven't enrolled to the waiting list to join the OnePass Bridge Pilot, you have to visit OnePass and [sign-up](https://app.getonepass.eu/signup). You will be requested to set up a user account (for you, as an individual) and a workspace (an account for the organization you belong to and that you want to enrol in this pilot).

To sign up, you will only be requested to include an email, a username and an authentication method (e.g. passkey) to create a user account and, once you click the link on the email sent to you to verify the email address you provided, a few additional data will be required to create your user account: i.e. fist name, last name, headline and location, but it's only compulsory to include the name details.

Read *About workspaces* article for more details on how to manage your workspace settings.

## Company and investor profile

This is the information about your company that will be **publicly shown** to the starups in the OnePass Bridge.

If you have been invited to join OnePass Bridge Pilot from the waiting list, it means that you already may have a user. In this case, you will receive a invitation link to join and will only have to claim your organization's workspace to start the onboarding.

:::info
The information included when creating your workspace builds your company profile. This is, you won't need to invest your time twice: if you nurture your workspace description, your company profile will be ready and the other way around. It's only compulsory to fill the company name and country when creating a workspace but you are encouraged to fill as much details as possible: it will help starups (and our own matchmaking algorithms) to understand if you are a good match for them.
:::

To create your profile from the option "My company profile" of the left-side menu, you may include the following elements:

- **Basic company info**: this is related to a few factual details about your company such as the location, the website, the year when it was founded, the number of employess (if any), tags to define your industry and the technologies you work with and the stage of growth in which your company is. To complete this information, click on the "Add basic info" button, fill the data and click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the window.

- **Overview**: use this section to include a short description of your activities to introduce your company to the starups: type your text and tap on the "Save" button at the bottom of the window. You can add some format to the text with the edition functionalities in the upper side of the screen and preview the result before saving it.

- **Images**: showcase your services with your own branded images by clicking on the "Add image", click on the "Select" button, choose the file you want to upload and tap the "Insert" button at the bottom of the window. If you want to delete or change an image, buttons to "Remove" and "Change" will appear underneath the image after uploading.
  [//]: # (Any specific formats allowed/rejected for pictures? Size?)

- **How we invest"**: this is one of the most important parts of your profile, because it describes the type of startups in which you would consider an investment. This information is also included in the "Investor profile" of the workspace settings. To fill it, click the "Edit investor profile" button at the botton of the "How we invest" section of your company profile and complete the following elements:

  - Contact email: this is the email address in which you would like to receive the emails from startups and, for this reason, it might be different from the email in the "Basic profile" section of your workspace settings.
    :::tip
    Remember to check if you spelled your email address correctly!

  - Founders introduction: select which is your preferred channel for startups to introduce themselves. Your preference will be starred in your profile for them to be aware of the best way to contact you.
    [//]: # (Warm introduction is for those companies in which matchmakins shows this investor as a match, right?)
    :::info
    If you select the "Warm introduction" option, means that our matchmaking mechanism will regularly deliver a selection of startups that match your investor profile. For any other option, remember to provide the corresponding relevant contact data (i.e. contact email, link to a form or website, etc.)

  - Countries of investment: start typing the name of each of the countries where may consider investing and select them from the list, one by one.
  - Investment focus: start typing and select any domains or technologies in which you may consider investing, also one by one.
    [//]: # (Are these tags from technologies ones? Industries? Both?)
  - Portfolio highlights: type the commercial name of the best startups that you invested in. Docs will probably help startups understand your investor profile better.
    [//]: # (I understand that invested companies do not need to be registered users of OnePass, right?)
    :::danger
    Remember to click the "Finish editing" black button when you are done!
    :::

- **Team**: click on the "Add a new member" button to the right of section name, complete the details of one team member at a time and click the black "Insert" button. Only their name, the country of citizenship, their role and the percentage of the equity they own are compulsory details for each team member and you do not need to add every member of your team. It's ok if you include only your key partners, including some more information about them.

- **Highlights"**: go to the tab with this same name and click on the "Add metric" button on the right side. It will allow you to add the name of the meassure you want to include and a value for it. Once done, remember to click on the "Insert" button at the bottom of the window. This means that it's you who decides which metrics are key to understand your activities and which you would like to show.

:::tip
You can complete (and edit) your company public profile from different entry points: from the workspace settings (in the box that will appear under your company name and logo in the upper right corner), from the "Complete your company profile" box in the "Homepage" and in the "My Company profile" option of the main menu of OnePass Bridge on the left.
However, there are slight differences: some functionalities related to that profile (such as tasks, notes, chat, etc.) are only shown if you access the profile from the "View complete profile" button in the "Homepage" and verification details are shown differently (in the workspace settings and in the complete profile you can see a complete overview of your verification status meanwhile this will only appear as a badge "Verified" in your public profile).

## Documents
