The ionvestors' homepage in OnePass Bridge is the first thing you'll see when accesing Bridge. It includes the main menu in the left side to help you navigate the platform and a summary update of important information, such as some indicators of your workspace visibility and your activity and the list recommended startups for you based on your profile.

From the **left side menu** you can access the following options and sections:

- **Getting started**, provides a picture of where you are on your onboarding process. Completing all the steps on this list will help you get the most out of the platform.
- **[My company profile](./investor-profile.md)** will guide you to the information about your company that you are showing to the ecosystem and that the platform will use to recommend you new startups.
- the **Document Hub** will lead you to a section where  you can effortlessly organize and share essential documents like the "Fund term sheet" or the "Fund memorandum"
- the [Source](./discovery.md) section, groups a series of options to help you discover and make contact with promising startups ("Companies") and founders ("People"), save your mix of criteria to identify them ("Save searches") or create lists to track them ("Lists" and "Watchlist")
- from the **[Connect](./connect.md)** section, you will find your "Directory", including the contacts of the companies and People in your network, and you can manage and follow-up your interactions within the platform by "messages", "email" or the "Pitch inbox".

The companies in this list will be suggested to your company based in your investor profile and the startups cards are shown in an overall list and grouped around the tags they were matched by. The company's details that will be shown whern cliking on each card, are the ones in the public company profile that can be seen in the ["Source"](./discovery.md) section.
