## Searching for your targeted startups

When you navigate to the search section, you find a text search and the list of companies by-default, where no additional filters are applied.

Click on the filters button (on the left, below the text box) and the tab "Filters" is preselected to unfold the criteria for your search:

- Organization type. This criterium is related to the nature of the companies you search for based on their side and other features (e.g. if they have been recently created (startups) or ready to grow (scaleups), or already established (sme), etc.)
- Stage. It will help you filter based on the degree of maturity of the company as per their own description, from idea to mature.
- Round. Use this criterium to find the companies that are searching for a particular round of investment from pre-seed to series C and beyond.
- Country. This will help you fence your results to a particular geographical scope.
- Industry. You can also segment companies by their activity area.
- Technologies. It refers to the main technology domains in wich the companies are workig and/or apply to their services or products.
- Headcount. This criterium will be useful if you are interested in companies of a given size in terms of employees.
- Year of foundation. You can filter companies that have been recently created or that have been established for a number of years with this criteria.
- Amount raised. This criterium will help you spot the companies that raised money within a range.
- Current valuation. Use this criterium if you are targeting companies within a valuation range.
