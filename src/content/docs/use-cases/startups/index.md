## OnePass Bridge Pilot for companies

If you have been invited to OnePass Bridge, there are a few steps you need to follow to onboard to the pilot:

1. [Introduce your startup with a public profile](./startup-profile.md)
2. [Upload your company documents](./documents.md)
3. [Submit your pitch deck](./pitch.md)
4. [Verify your company information](./verification.md)

If you already had a user account in OnePass (because you joined the waitlist or if you have been invited from other projects which verfied your company previously), you can sign in with your regular user and authentication and you can select your organization (if you had one) to transform it to a workspace.

Remember that you can also join an existing workspace if someone else from your team already created it or claim a guest profile if it's unclaimed.

In any case, after you sign-in, you will land in the "Homepage", from where you can navigate and control your activity within the OnePass Bridge. In the following sections there a brief explanation on how to use it.
