## Creating a workspace

A "workspace" is a representation of an organization (be it a company, a project or simply the idea of a team) to which one person or many people belong and jointly manage.

If you haven't enrolled to the waiting list to join the OnePass Bridge Pilot, you have to visit OnePass and [sign-up](https://app.getonepass.eu/signup). You will be requested to set up a user account (for you, as an individual) and a workspace (an account for the organization you belong to and that you want to enrol in this pilot).

For your individual account, you will only be requested to include your profesional email (from your company's domain) and, once you include the one-time verification code we will send to the email address you provided, a few additional data will be required to create your user account: i.e. fist name, last name, headline and location, but it's only compulsory to include the name details.

If you already have a user account, you will be invited to create a workspace to start the onboarding. If you also had an organization linked to your user account, you will only have to select it to transform it to a workspace. Remember that you can also join an existing workspace (e.g: if someone else from your team already created it) or claim a guest profile if it's unclaimed.

Devote some time to complete the information of your workspace, because all the information you provide at this point will be feeding your company profile and, hence, later you won't have to start this profile from scratch.

Read *About workspaces* article for more details on how to manage your workspace settings.

## Company profile

The startup profile is the information of your company that will be available publicly to the investors and startups in OnePass.

You will be requested to set a public profile for your company as part of the onboarding. The company profile is your entry point for investors and other companies. It should be concise but complete and catchy for your company to stand out among others (Visit the startup toolbox for further advise).
