## Create your pitch deck

A pitch deck is usually a simple 10 - 20 slide presentation designed to help founders raise capital. As such, it should give a brief and compelling presentation of a new business idea that entrepreneurs give to potential investors, customers, or partners.

You can add your pitch from different places:

* from the "Getting started" menu, click the "Manage" button on the third section "Submit your pitch to Pitch Relay",
* from the "Documents" tab of "My company profile", click the "plus" icon to the right of "All documents" black selection box, or
* from the "Documents hub".

To upload your pitch from the option "Documents Hub" of the main side menu, following these steps:

* Click on the tab "Pitch deck" type (just below the initial explanatory text).
* Click the "Upload" button and, then, the "Select" one,
* Choose the file you want to upload (it might be a .pdf or a .ppt) and click "Open" and
* finally, click the "Upload document" black button.

:::info
If you want to change or delete your pitch, go to the "Document versions" tab and click on the three dots icon ("Actions"): it will show you options to both "Edit", "Upload a new version" and "Remove". If you click on the "Upload a new version" button you will be requested to select a new file and save. This same icon will provide many other options to help you manage the pitch deck file. See the section "Manage and follow-up on access to your pitch" for more details about them.

## Share the pitch deck

The content of your pitch won't be shown in your public company profile, but there are are two different ways in which you can share it:

1. you can create a link, with different accesss options, to share it proactively with whom you want or
2. you can do a pitch relay and we will distribute it among the investors in our pool looking for companies like yours.

To **create a link** to share your pitch, you have to click on the "Documents Hub" option of the left side menu, click on the "Pitch deck" type and, then, in the tab "Links & access requests", on the "Create link" button.
For each link, you will be able to define:

* who may have access (this is, anyone with the link or only people who additionally have a password that you can create if you choose this option),
* the title of the link,
* a short description and
* an expiration date (that might be as long or short as you wish depending on your needs).

When all the details are covered, remember to click on the "Add link" button at the bottom of the window to save the information.

:::info
You can create as many links as you need: e.g. you may want to have a permanent link for the invitations you send and a short-term one for a particular company you met at, let's say, an event. You will also be able to refresh or update your pitch also from this space.
:::

On the other hand, in the case of the **pitch relay**, the process follows these steps:

1. Submit your pitch: click on the option "Submit your pitch" of the "Getting started" menu. Read the short overview of the process and click again the "Submit your pitch" button and fill the fundraising preferences form including:
   * define the type of investors you target,
   * add a breaker one-liner intro,
   * include a short pitch (an elevator pitch to up to 500 characters),
   * answer a few questions on the current situation of your business and the investment you search for and, if you wish, link to Calendly in case that investors would like to book a slot to talk to you, and
   * decide if you want to share only your pitch or both your pitch and your dataroom and activate accordingly the radio buttons.
  
2. Pitch review: the pitches will be automatically reviewed on a monthly basis in order to make sure they are mature enough to be introduced to our pool of verified investors.
[//]: # (Will we comunicate to them if the pitch do not goes through the review?)

3. Pitch distribution: if your pitch goes through the review successfully, it will be routed to investors who are looking for companies at your stage, industry, business model, location and/or round size. If any of those investors expresses interest, youâ€™ll receive a warm intro.

4. Redressing the pitch: if your pitch is not selected, you will have a chance to improve it and resubmit after three months.

:::info
You can follow up on the pitches that you sent by clicking on the "Sent pitches" tab of the "Pitch Relay" option of the "Connect" section of the main side menu. In the "Relay tab" of this same option, you will see the details (Short pitch and requested investment) of the relay currently active, including the information of your audience, if the pitch was accepted or dissmissed, when it was submitted and the number of views that it has achieved.
:::

:::warning
If you want to change your short pitch or any of the details included during the submission of your pitch relay, you will have to archive that submission and start a new one. This does not apply to your startup profile or documents: the latest version available online is the one that will be shown to investors (if you grant access).

## Manage and follow-up on access to your pitch

The "Pitch deck" type of the "Documents Hub" in the main side menu will help you to follow-up on the pitches you share.

In the tab **"Links & Access requests"**, you will see a list of the links (active and archived) that you created to your pitch and another list of the users that have requested access to your pitch, including their name and email account:

* For each of the links in the first two lists (Active links and Archived links), click on the three dots to the right to preview the pitch, copy the link, edit it or deactivate/reactivate it.
* In the second list, you can click on the username (right besides the user avatar) that requested access to obtain further details about this user and click on the three dots to the right ("Actions") to approve or reject the request (or to revoke the permission at any point after granting it).

You can also follow-up on the versions of your pitch in the tab **"Document versions"**. By clicking on the three dots icon ("Actions") at the right of each version, you will be able to preview or edit the pitch, upload a new version, edit the metadata of the file, see the document information, see the document analytics, the version history, download the file or delete it. In the older versions (which have been replace by a newer one), instead of this icon you will see a button to restore it.

:::warning
Be aware that, if you restore an older version, you will replace the current one.
:::

Finally, you will find an **"Analytics"** tab that will help you keep track of the visits that your pitch received during the last 6 months. If you place your pointer over the bar in the chart, you will see the complete date and the total number of visits in that day. You can also export this information (if e.g. you want to have a history longer of seven days), by clicking the three dots that will appear if you drag your mouse over the right upper corner of the chart and click the "Download results" option.
Below, you can see a summary of count of total visits and a count of the views in the last 30 days.
In this section there is also a list of the recent views, including the user who visited, the content reviewed and the date when it happened.
