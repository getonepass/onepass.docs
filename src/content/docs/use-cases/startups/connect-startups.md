You can manage all your communications within OnePass Bridge under the "Connect" option of the main left side menu, including the direct messages for both you, as an individual user, and for your workspace, i.e. all your team. 


## Messaging

This section includes all the direct messages sent to you or to your workspace through OnePass Bridge. When you visit the "Connect" section, you will land in the "All chats" option of the left side menu, to give you a complete overview of the ongoing conversations. It's possible to pin conversations: they can be found in the "Pinned" option of the left side menu. You can also archive the conversations that are not active any more and see them in the "Archived" option.

Additionally, messages are organized in different categories in the menus below to find them faster and manage them easier. In each of these categories, you will see a list of chats. 
* Click in any chat of the list to see and take part in the conversation (you just need to write a message and click the send icon to participate).
* You can also see the information about the chat by clicking in the info icon in the left upper corner of the chat window: who started the chat and when, how many people is included in the chat and who they are and the number of messages in the conversation.
* From the three dots icon (More actions), you will be able to pin (or unpin) the conversation if you want to have it at hand. Additionally, if it's a group chat, you will also be able to leave the chat under this same icon.

### Personal inbox
Go to the "Personal inbox" option in the left side menu to see the messges that are addressed to your specific user. The messages are grouped in 2 categories:
* "Direct messages": for those which are only addressing your user. The first time you want to write a message, a black button "Write a message" will appear in the central are of the screen. After that, use the "plus" icon next to the "Personal inbox" headline in the side menu.
* "Group chats": for those which are addressed to a group in which you participate. A black "Start a new chat group" button will appear in the central screen for your first group and will ask your for a title, the participants and a brief description of the group chat. After that, use the "layers" icon next to the  to the "Personal inbox" headline in the side menu.

Whenever another user wants to start a conversation with you, you will receive a request. You can check them at the "Chat requests" option in the left side menu.

### Company inbox
You will find in this option of the left side menu the conversations in which your organization is taking part, including the ones that you started and the ones that were started by other team members. In the option "All threads" you will see them all but, to make it easier for you to identify a particular conversation, you can go to the option "Created by me" to see the ones you started or to the option "Assigned to me" to see the ones that you should be leading.

### Relay chats
The messages related to pitch relay will appear separatedly in this section, so that you can find them and address them easily and fast.


## Pitch relay

In this section, you can follow up on the pitches that you sent.

In the "Relay tab" you will see the details of the relay currently active, including the information of your audience, if the pitch was accepted or dissmissed, when it was submitted and the number of views that it has achieved.

:::warning
If you want to change your short pitch or any of the details included during the submission of your pitch relay, you will have to archive that submission and start a new one. This does not apply to your startup profile or documents: the latest version available online is the one that will be shown to investors (if you grant access).
:::

On the other hand, in the "Sent pitches" tab you will see a list of all the sent pitch (in the current relay or in previous ones), including for each of them details on who received it, for which round and capital were you pitching, the status, the date of submissions and the number of views that it achieved.
