## OnePass notifications

It's possible to reach the notifications preferences from the "User account settings" or the "Notifications preferences" button that you will find by clicking on the image of your user's avatar.

In the notifications preferences you will be able to set up if you want to be notified about new features on OnePass and if you want to receive OnePass Newsletter. For this:
- Log in to your OnePass account.
- Navigate to the "Account Settings" page.
- Click on the "Notifications" tab.
- Click on the checkbox of the option(s) you want to activate.

Remember that you can modify your preferences at any point and notice that, even if you opt out of all options, OnePass still send you important administrative emails and account-related notifications, like password resets.
