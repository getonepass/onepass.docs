## Profile

You will only be required a "First name" and "Last name" to create a user profile, but there are some aditional information you can fill to customize your profile, wherever it appears, to be shown to other OnePass users :

- Profile image (an image or avatar that will work as an icon for your profile).
- Headline (a one-sentence description of your role and experience)
- Location (type the name of the city where you are based)
- Bio (a few lines of your professional trajectory)
- Job Search (mark the correponding radio button to indicate if you are looking for a job).

Remember that any information you fill will be publicly used across OnePass. Read the our [privacy statement](https://getonepass.eu/trust/privacy) to learn more about this.
