## Create or join a workspace

A "workspace" is a space to which one person or many people belong and jointly manage. It might represent an idea, a project, a startup, a organization... The workspace

Once your user account is ready, you can create your workspace by:

1. clicking on the "Create an organization workspace" button,
2. providing the organization name and type and the country where the organization is located (as a minimum), as well as the url of the organization website and a contact email (if you wish to) and
3. clicking on the "Next" button at the bottom to save the information.

:::info
There is little information that is compulsory to fill to create your workspace but remember that the workspace and your company profile share a good deal of information. This is, the more information you provide at this point, the less you will need to include later.
:::

If you already had an account before, you will probably have an organization account which you need to convert to a "workspace". You can add team members to that workspace in the "Workspace settings" button that appears when clicking in the name of your workspace in the upper rigth side of the next (just by your avatar).

Also, if some of your colleagues has already created a workspace for your organization previously, you can join it (no need to create the workspace again) by clicking on the "Join an existing workspace" button of your profile.

Remember that, if you belong to more than one organization, you may create a workspace for each of those and that your "workspace" and the "public company profile" share the information that you will be able to update from any of those. However, the workspace settings include some options that can only be managed from the workspace settings:

- Team members access and permissions,
- Generation and management of tokens to access the OnePass API
- Creation and management of sender identities (this is email accounts linked to your workspace for the communication through OnePass) and
- eMail account and organization domain verification.

A list of the "Workspaces" that you belong to can be seen from the "Organizations" tab of your user account settings. This list shows the icon of the workspace, its name, your role within that particular workspace and one button to go to each workspace settings and another to leave each of the workspaaces.

You can also switch from one workspace to another by clicking on the avatar and name of the workspace that you are using and that will appear always in the right upper corner of the page. Once unfolded, the workspaces you belong to will appear beneath the section " Switch context to" and you only have to click on the name of the one you want to switch to.

## Rename, close or delete a workspace

The workspace is named after the "Organization name" that you provide on the "Basic profile" tab of the workspace settings.

- click the "Save" button (or the cancel one if you change your mind).

:::caution
Please, think twice before renaming a workspace as it might have unintended side effects.

- sign in to your OnePass account,
